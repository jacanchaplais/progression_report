two different events, both collide two protons, produces:
- p p > g Z > (g > b b~), (Z > l l~)
    - Henry and Giorgio are only producing electrons
        - because easier to remove from results
    - Z provides transverse momentum
- p p > H Z > (h > b b~), (Z > l l~)

gluon has colour charge 

one event, shower many time
- Giorgio says they set the mass of the gluon and Higgs to be the same
  then generate hard process thousands of times with cuts on the momenta.
  After that, they compare the events to find the most similar, then shower.
