The network was then scaled up to the full size of 128 dimensional embeddings
per layer, with 7 MLP graph layers as per the original work. This was
parallelised across four GPUs, which thus increased the batch size of the
training to 4 graphs. This was trained over 40 epochs, and yielded an
accuracy of xx\%, with recall of yy\%, and a precision of zz\%.

It was then possible to reconstruct the mass of the particles generating the
jet, with resonance plots shown below.
